# Alzapar Grammar: Word Order

The basic sentence structure of the formal literary language is that of Verb-Subject-Object. For example an English sentence with all components (verb, subject, and object) would "Sam ate apples". Where Sam is the subject (the one doing the action), ate is the verb (the action itself), and apples are the object (the one(s) recieving the action). The order of Alżapar however would make the sentence "ate Sam apples". That example sentence translated being "ukála Samũ meláã". 

Adverbial phrases (phrases which modify the meaning of a verb) are put before the verb of a sentence. For example the sentence "One day I gave (to) the boy a ball" would be translated as *Jumĩ karĩ lejn al-abénĩ lutáha miũ al-paláã* (literally: "Day arbitrary to the-boy gave me the-ball"). 

The internal order of descriptors generally should follow the format of:
1. Quantity
2. Head Noun
3. Opinion or Evaluation
4. Size
5. Age
6. Form or Shape
7. Color
8. Origin, Material, or Purpose
