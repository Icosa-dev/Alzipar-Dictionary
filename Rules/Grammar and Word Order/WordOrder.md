# Alżapar Grammar: Word Order

The basic sentence structure of the formal literary language is that of VSO ("Ate sam apples"). However informal and common speech may often take the form of SVO ("Sam ate apples"). Adverbial phrases come after the object in both cases. For example a formal literary sentence may be *Jusmaka as-simakun aṡ-ṡivazan al-baridin* however in common speech it may be said as *As-simakun jusmaka aṡ-ṡivazan al-baridin*. Both translate to "The fish is swimming in the cold water".

The internal order of descriptors generally should follow the format of:
1. Quantity
2. Head Noun
3. Opinion or Evaluation
4. Size
5. Age
6. Form or Shape
7. Color
8. Origin, Material, or Purpose

For example to describe "Three tasty large, fresh, black coffees" in the language would be *Tirah kopiun lakirin kabirin friskin aswadin* which translates literally to "Three coffee tasty big fresh black".

Prepositions are always put before and connected to a verb. For example the sentence "The fish swam towards the turtle" would be translated as *Lejn-sumaka al-simakun al-fekrunan* (literally: "Towards-swam the fish the turtle"). The exception to this is when there is no verb.

Adverbial phrases go before the verb of a sentence. For example the sentence "One day the dog ran" would be *Jumun karin ġaraha al-kalebun* (literally "Day-NOM arbitrary-GEN run-PAST the-dog-NOM").
