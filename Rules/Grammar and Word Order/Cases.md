# Alżapar Grammar: Noun Cases

Nouns can take 3 case markers: Nominative, accusative, and genitive. The case of a noun relates to it's function in the clause as either the subject or object. The subject is the part of the clause which does the verb. The object is the part of the clause which the verb is being done onto. All clauses will have subjects but not all will have objects. 

## Nominative Case

A noun is in the nominative case if it is part of the subject of a clause. If a noun is in the nominative case it is suffixed with *ũ* in the Latin script or with the ـٌ diacritic in the Arabic script. Both make the /un/ sound. However in speech the n may be omitted.

## Accusative Case

A noun is in the accusative case if it is part of the object of a clause. If a a noun is in the accusative case it is suffixed with *ã* in the Latin script or with the ـً diacritic in the Arabic script. Both make the /an/ sound. However in speech the n may be omitted.

## Genitive Case

A noun or adjective is in the genitive case if it directly follows a preposition. An example of its use with prepositions is *fi al-bajtĩ* which means "in the house".

The genitive case is also used to mark a noun as being a quality or owned by the noun before it. An example of its use with quality is *Babũ al-bajtĩ* which means "the house's door" or more literally "door (of) the house". In this case of description the noun being described is never definite however the words describing it are.
