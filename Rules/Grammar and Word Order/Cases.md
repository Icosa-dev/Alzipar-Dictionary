# Alżapar Grammar: Noun Cases

Nouns can take 3 case markers. Nominative, accusative, and genitive. 

The nominative case (which is suffixed to a noun as "-un") marks the noun as being part of the subject of a clause. 

The accusative case marks the noun as being part of the object of a clause. Unlike with languages like Latin or German there is no complementary dative case. This means both the direct and indirect object are marked with the accusative case.

The genitive case marks the noun as being a quality of another and is put on nouns after prepositions. For example the English phrase "the capital of the republic" would be translated as "al-Kapitaliun ar-Republikin". The capital is the subject in this example and has the quality of being of the republic. There isn't actually a word for "of" in this case because its use is replaced by the genitive.

For example the sentence "I gave the boy the book of poetry". "I" is the subject of the sentence so it would be marked with the nominative case. "gave" is a verb and wouldn't be marked with a noun case. "the boy" and "the book" are both part of the object of the sentence. "of poetry" would have the noun "poetry" marked with the genitive case since it describes the quality of the book and is after the preposition "of".

So in all, after translating the phrases from English to Alżapar:
|     English      |      Alżapar     |
|------------------|------------------|
|       I          |        Mi        |
|       Gave       |       Lutaha     |
|       The Boy    |      Al-Aben     |
|       The Book   |      Al-Kitab    |
|       Of Poetry  |      Aṡ-Ṡajar    |

Then adding the case markers to each noun: Mi -> Miun, Al-Aben -> Al-Abenan, Al-Kitab -> Al-Kitaban, Aṡ-Ṡajarin. Then in proper order (VSO) the sentence would be translated as:
*"Lutaha miun al-Abenan al-Kitaban Aṡ-Ṡajarin."*
