# Alzapar Grammar: Noun Cases

Nouns can take 3 case markers: Nominative, accusative, and genitive. The case of a noun relates to it's function in the clause as either the subject or object. The subject is the part of the clause which does the verb. The object is the part of the clause which the verb is being done onto. All clauses will have subjects but not all will have objects. 

In formal speech case markers are required to be pronounced. In casual speech they are almost always omitted.

In writing case markers tend to be omitted including in voiced Arabic texts and Latin texts. They are mainly included in poetic or highly formal texts where exact pronunciation is important or in texts for learners.

## Nominative Case

A noun is in the nominative case if it is part of the subject of a clause. If a noun is in the nominative case it is suffixed with *ũ* in the Latin script or with the ـٌ diacritic in the Arabic script. Both make the /un/ sound.

## Accusative Case

A noun is in the accusative case if it is part of the object of a clause. If a a noun is in the accusative case it is suffixed with *ã* in the Latin script or with the ـً diacritic in the Arabic script. Both make the /an/ sound.

## Genitive Case

The genitive case has 4 uses:
1) To mark a noun as being directly after a preposition
2) To mark a noun as being owned by the nown before it
3) To mark a noun or adjective as being a quality of the noun before it
4) To mark a noun as being part of an adverbial phrase

The first use is self explainatory. If a noun directly follows a preposition it is put in the genitive case. For example *Fi al-bajtĩ* (meaning "in the house") has the word *bajt* in the genitive case because it is directly after the preposition *fi*.

The second use is to mark a noun being owned by another. For example to say "the republic's capital" you would say *kapitálũ ar-republíkĩ* (literally: "capital (of) the republic"). In this case if the word which owns is in the definite form then the words in the genitive case get the *al-* article and not the word itself.

The third use is to mark a noun or adjective as being a quality of the noun before it. For example to say "the blue sky" you would say *as-símahũ az-zaríqĩ* (literally: "the sky the blue"). 

The fourth and final use is to mark a noun as being part of an adverbial phrase. That is to say, describing a verb. For example to say "one day I walked to the store" you would say *Jumĩ karĩ lejn ruġála miũ al-ħażnáã* (literally: "Day arbitrary to walked me the store"). In this case the noun *Jum* (day) is describing the verb and as such is put in the genitive case.
