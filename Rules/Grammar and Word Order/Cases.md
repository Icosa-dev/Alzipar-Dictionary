# Alżapar Grammar: Noun Cases

Nouns can take 3 case markers: Nominative, accusative, and genitive. 

## Nominative Case

A noun is in the nominative case if it is part of the subject of a clause. If a noun is in the nominative case it is suffixed with *ũ* in the Latin script or with the ـٌ diacritic in the Arabic script. Both make the /un/ sound. However in speech the n may be omitted.

## Accusative Case

A noun is in the accusative case if it is part of the object of a clause, both direct and indirect. If a anoun is in the accusative case it is suffixed with *ã* in the Latin script or with the ـً diacritic in the Arabic script. Both make the /an/ sound. However in speech the n may be omitted.

## Genitive Case

A noun or adjective is in the genitive case if it follows a preposition. The genitive case is also used to mark a noun as being a quality or owned by the noun before it. An example of its use with prepositions is *fi al-bajtĩ* which means "in the house". An example of its use with quality is *Babũ al-bajtĩ* which means "the house's door" or more literally "door (of) the house". In this case of description the noun being described is never definite however the words describing it are.
