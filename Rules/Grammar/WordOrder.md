# Alzapar Grammar: Word Order

The basic sentence structure is that of Verb-Subject-Object (VSO). English is an SVO language and as such would order the sentence "Sam ate apples" as such. However Alzapar would order the words as "Ate Sam apples" instead. Or more literally "Ākala Sām mulā". 

Adverbs and adverbial phrases are put before the verb which they modify. For example the sentence "I gave (to) the boy a ball one day" would be translated as "Yūm karīn lī al-abn lāta'a mī al-bilā" (literally: "Day some to the-boy gave me the-ball).

The internal order of descriptors generally should follow the format of:
1. Quantity
2. Head Noun
3. Opinion or Evaluation
4. Size
5. Age
6. Form or Shape
7. Color
8. Origin, Material, or Purpose
