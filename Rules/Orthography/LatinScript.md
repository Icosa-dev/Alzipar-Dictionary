# Alżapar Orthography: Latin Script

The standard orthography for the language calls for the use of the Latin script. For consistency the entire manual will write Alżapar words in this orthographic standard unless used for demonstration of other scripts.
The following is the Latin alphabet for the language along with IPA values for each letter:

|   Letter   |   IPA   |
|------------|---------|
| Aa         |   /a/   |
| Bb         |   /b/   |
| Dd         |   /d/   |
| Ee         |   /ε/   |
| Ff         |   /f/   |
| Ġġ         |   /ʤ/   |
| Gg         |   /g/   |
| Hh         |   N/A   |
| Ħħ         |   /h/   |
| Ii         |   /i/   |
| Jj         |   /j/   |
| Kk         |   /k/   |
| Ll         |   /l/   |
| Mm         |   /m/   |
| Nn         |   /n/   |
| O          |   /o/   |
| Pp         |   /p/   |
| Qq         |   /q/   |
| Rr         |   /r/   |
| Ss         |   /s/   |
| Tt         |   /t/   |
| Uu         |   /u/   |
| Vv         |   /v/   |
| Ww         |   /w/   |
| Żż         |   /z/   |
| Zz         |   /ʦ/   |

Words are generally spelled as they sound. 

Vowels if written together are never pronounced together.

If the vowel of an affix connects to the same vowel in the root they are pronounced together and written as the same vowel. The exception to this is with the case markers which do not assimilate.

The letter *Hh* which makes no sound is used as a placeholder to follow the triconsonantal root patern. The letter *Ħħ* is the one which actually makes the English "h" sound. If initial the letter *Hh* can be dropped.

The first letter of a sentence is capitalized. Proper nouns are also capitalized and proper nouns of great significance may be written in all caps. Sentences are seperated by full stops and words are seperated by spaces. The word before a conjunction will have a comma appended to it.

In informal writting the case markers can be excluded.

If a word using the definite article begins with a sun consonant then the "l" is replaced with that consonant. For example "the water" would be translated as *aṡ-ṡivaz(un)*.

The acute accent can be used to mark which vowel is elongated in a word. However this is not required as vowel elongation is generally very regular. If used, it tends to only be used on polysylabic words and once. The exception is for compound words. For example *Kitabami* would have elongation on both the *a* of *Kitab* and *i* of *mi*. Hence, *Kitábamí*.
