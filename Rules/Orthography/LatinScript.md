# Alżapar Orthography: Latin Script

The standard orthography for the language calls for the use of the Latin script. For consistency the entire manual will write Alżapar words in this orthographic standard unless used for demonstration of other scripts.
The following is the Latin alphabet for the language along with IPA values for each letter:

|   Letter   |   IPA   |
|------------|---------|
| Aa         |   /a/   |
| Bb         |   /b/   |
| Dd         |   /d/   |
| Ee         |   /ε/   |
| Ff         |   /f/   |
| Ġġ         |   /ʤ/   |
| Gg         |   /g/   |
| Hh         |   /ʔ/   |
| Ħħ         |   /h/   |
| Ii         |   /i/   |
| Jj         |   /j/   |
| Kk         |   /k/   |
| Ll         |   /l/   |
| Mm         |   /m/   |
| Nn         |   /n/   |
| O          |   /o/   |
| Pp         |   /p/   |
| Qq         |   /q/   |
| Rr         |   /r/   |
| Ss         |   /s/   |
| Tt         |   /t/   |
| Uu         |   /u/   |
| Vv         |   /v/   |
| Ww         |   /w/   |
| Żż         |   /z/   |
| Zz         |   /ʦ/   |

Words are spelled as they sound. The letter *Hh* which makes no sound or the glottal stop if between vowels is used as a placeholder to follow the triconsonantal root patern. The letter *Ħħ* is the one which actually makes the English "h" sound.

The first letter of a sentence is capitalized. Proper nouns of great significance may be written in all caps. Sentences are seperated by full stops and words are seperated by spaces. The word before a conjunction will have a comma appended to it.

In informal writting the case markers can be excluded.

If a word using the definite article begins with a sun consonant then the "l" is replaced with that consonant. For example "the water" would be translated as *aṡ-ṡivaz(un)*.

The acute diacritic can be used on the vowel of a stressed sylable however this is uncommon. Most words will have the stress on the penultimate sylable: *kitábun, namudnábun, ṡivázun, baríkin, jaqáfa, jahmára, etc*. The main exception to this and primary reason to use it is for loan words such as *róża, persúna, rispét, komúnita, stáġun, etc*.
