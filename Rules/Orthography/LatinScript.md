Words are spelled as they sound.

The first word of a sentence and all nouns (sans pronouns) are capitalized. Proper nouns of great significance may be written in all caps. Sentences are seperated by full stops and words are seperated by spaces.

In informal writting the case markers can be excluded.

When using the definite article "Al-" if it is the first word of a sentence it may be capitalized otherwise it is not capitalized, however the noun itself is. For example "the book" would be translated as "al-Kitab(un)" and not "Al-Kitab(un)" unless it's the first word of a sentence.

If a word using the definite article begins with a sun consonant then the "l" is replaced with that consonant. For example "the water" would be translated as "aṡ-Ṡivaz(un)".
