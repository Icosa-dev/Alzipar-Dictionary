|     م      |   /m/       | 
|     ن      |   /n/       |
|     و      |   /w,u,o/   |
|     ي      |   /j,i/     |

|   Diacritic   |   Case   |   IPA   |
|---------------|----------|---------|
|       ـَ       |   N/A    |  /a/    |
|       ـِ       |   N/A    |  /i, ɛ/ |
|       ـُ       |   N/A    |  /u, o/ |
|       ـٌ       |   Nom.   |  /un/   |
|       ـً       |   Acc.   |  /an/   |
|       ـٍ       |   Gen.   |  /in/   |

Alif is only used as vowel carrier if a word begins with a vowel.

Diacritics are not required and in most cases shouldn't be use.



Ayn is used much like the Latin script's *Hh* in which it is used as a placeholder for a sounded consonant in a triconsonantal root or for vowel hiatus.


Sentences are seperated by full stops and words are seperated by spaces.

Unlike with the Latin orthography the definitive article is always written as "اَلْـ" even when the Lam is silent. For example the word /alkitabun/ would be written as "" and the word /aʃivaʦun/ would be written as "".

Words connected by "-" in Latin are written as one in the Arabic script.
