|   Diacritic   |   Case   |   IPA   |
|---------------|----------|---------|
|       ـَ       |   N/A    |  /a/    |
|       ـِ       |   N/A    |  /i, ɛ/ |
|       ـُ       |   N/A    |  /u, o/ |
|       ـٌ       |   Nom.   |  /un/   |
|       ـً       |   Acc.   |  /an/   |
|       ـٍ       |   Gen.   |  /in/   |

Alif is only used as vowel carrier if a word begins with a vowel. In a similar vein, Ya and Waw are never used as vowels only as consonants.

Diacritics are not required and in most cases shouldn't be. They are the only way of marking vowels as per the rule above stating no mater lectionis (vowels written as consonants).

Sentences are seperated by full stops and words are seperated by spaces.

Unlike with the Latin orthography the definitive article is always written as "اَلْـ" even when the Lam is silent. For example the word /alkitabun/ would be written as "اَلْكِتَبٌ" and the word /aʃivaʦun/ would be written as "اَلْشِڤَصٌ".

Words connected by "-" in Latin are written as one in the Arabic script.
