# Alzapar Orthography: Latin Script

The standard orthography for the language calls for the use of the Latin script. For consistency the entire manual will write Alzapar words in this orthographic standard unless used for demonstration of other scripts.
The following is the Latin alphabet for the language along with IPA values for each letter:

Words are spelled as they sound. 

The first letter of a sentence is capitalized. Proper nouns are also capitalized and proper nouns of great significance may be written in all caps. Sentences are seperated by full stops and words are seperated by spaces. The word before a conjunction will have a comma.

Long vowels are represented by a macron above the vowel or by writing two of the same vowel. For example: "kitāb/kitaab".

The definite article "al" is connected to the word it makes definite by a hyphen. For example "the book" would be "al-kitāb".

If a word using the definite article begins with a sun consonant then the "l" is replaced with that consonant. For example "the water" would be "aš-šivāts".
