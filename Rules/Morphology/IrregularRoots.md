# Alzapar Morphology: Irregular Roots

## Quadraconsonantal:

In the case of roots with 4 consonants they still use the root forms as defined in the other chapters.

The way the 4th root is handled is that in words that follow a -1V2V3- form the 2nd and 3rd consonants are written together. For example B-R-H-N (to prove or proof) in the past tense intransative form (1a2a3a) is written as *barhana*.

However in words that follow a -12V3- form the 4th consonant is appended with the vowel proceeding the 3rd consonant. For example B-R-H-N in the present tense intransative form (ya12u3u) is written as *yabruhunu*. 

## Diconsonantal:

To derive a root from a word with only 2 consonants you take the core 2 consonants add add "'" to the beginning or end depending on which has a vowel (and the end always if neither side of the word has a vowel). Given a word with two consonants if it takes the form V1V2(V) the new triconsonanatal root form will be '-1-2. If it takes the form 1V2(V) the new triconsonantal root form will be 1-2-'.
