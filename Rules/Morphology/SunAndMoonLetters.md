# Alzapar Morphology: Sun and Moon Letters

Much like Arabic and Maltese, Alzapar makes the distinction of Sun consonants and Moon consonants. Their distinction arrises from how they modify the definite article *al-*.

Sun consonants, when at the begining of a word which has the definite article, will make the *l* silent and replace its sound with that of itself; it assimilates the initial consonant. For both consonants this is self evident. The letter *s* is a sun consonant because it assimilates. It's *As-Sol* and not *Al-Sol* for this reason. The letters *d, n, r, s, š, t,* and *z* are all sun consonants.

Moon consonants, when at the begining of a word which has the definite article, will not assimilate the initial consonant. The letter *l* is a moon consonant as in *Al-Luna*. For a better example (since l is already present in the article) take the word for book *Kitāb*. Instead of *Ak-Kitāb* it's *Al-Kitāb* since *k* is a moon consonant. Moreover all vowels are non-assimilating such as *Al-Abn*. The letters *b, f, ġ, g, h, j, k, l, m, p, q, v, w* and *x* are all moon consonants.
