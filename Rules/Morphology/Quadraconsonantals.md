# Alzapar Morphology: Quadraconsonantals

In the case of roots with 4 consonants they still use the root forms as defined in the other chapters.

The way the 4th root is handled is that in words that follow a -1V2V3- form the 2nd and 3rd consonants are written together. For example B-R-Ħ-N (to prove or proof) in the past tense intransative form (1a2a3a) is written as *barħána*.

However in words that follow a -12V3- form the 4th consonant is appended with the vowel proceeding the 3rd consonant. For example B-R-Ħ-N in the present tense intransative form (Ja12a3a) is written as *jabraħána*.
