# Alzapar Morphology: Descriptor Forms

Descriptive words which describe the quality of nouns or verbs are also able to be formed with transfix forms of their own. 

Given a root (1-2-3) and its general meaning (X) a noun may take the following forms: 
|   Form   |     Noun      |     Meaning                            |     Form Name                    |
