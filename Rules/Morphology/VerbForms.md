# Alżapar Morphology: Verb Forms

Verbs of the core vocabulary take triconsonantal form. That is to say they have a 3 consonant root (1-2-3) which is then affixed and transfixed to create new verbs. Not every verb in the language is triconsonantal. Not every root may have every form defined. And nouns, esspecially loan nouns, will tend to stray from the predefined roots.

Given a root (1-2-3) and its general meaning (X) a verb may take the following forms:
|   Form   |   Past Tense (Default)     |   Present Tense   |   Meaning                       |   Form Name            |
|----------|----------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------|
|   (V0)   |           N/A              |        N/A        |   Irregular non-rooted verb     | Forma (Verbali) Garib  |
|   (V1)   |          1a2a3a            |      Ja12a3a      |   To do X                       | Forma Komuni           | 
|   (V2)   |          1u2a3a            |      Ju12a3a      |   To do X unto something        | Forma Transitiv        |
|   (V3)   |          A12a3a            |      Ju12i3u      |   To make someone do X          | Forma Każativ          |
|   (V4)   |          Ta1a2a3a          |      Jata1a2a3a   |   To do X unto oneself          | Forma Refleksiv        |
|   (V5)   |          Ta1a2a3u          |      Jata1a2a3u   |   To do X unto one another      | Forma Kooperativ       |
|   (V6)   |          I12a3a            |      Jai12a3a     |   To become X                   | Forma Transformativ    |
|   (V7)   |          Ista12a3a         |      Jasta12a3a   |   To ask to do X                | Forma Kurjuż           |

The first form can also act as an infinitive form.

Beyond the past and present tense are the future and perfect tense which can be achieved by taking the past tense form and adding the "sa-" or "ma-" prefix respectively.

Verbs (regular and irregular) can take on affixes such as: 
|   Affix   |          Meaning          |
|-----------|---------------------------|
|    Ro-    |   To do again             |

|    Li-    |   To do less of           |
