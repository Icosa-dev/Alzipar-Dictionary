# Alżapar Morphology: Noun Forms

Nouns can also be created via roots moddified with transfix forms. However it is much more common to have nouns which exist alone not connected to any root. As with verbs not every root may have every form defined. 

Given a root (1-2-3) and its general meaning (X) a noun may take the following forms: 
|   Form   |     Noun      |     Meaning                            |     Form Name             |
|----------|---------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------|
|    (N0)  |      N/A      |   Irregular non-rooted form            |     Forma (Non) Garib     |
|    (N1)  |  1i2a3/1a2a3  |   Singular noun form                   |     Forma Singulari       |
|    (N2)  |  1u2a3        |   Dual noun form                       |     Forma Dopju           |
|    (N3)  |  1u2u3        |   Plural noun form                     |     Forma Plural          |
|    (N4)  |  Mu12i3       |   Someone who does (X)                 |     Forma Aġent Singulari |
|    (N5)  |  Ma12a3       |   Place where (x) is done              |     Forma Lokalita        |

Note that form (N1) is split. (N1) is special in the fact that it can refer to both material (Forma Materjal Singulari) and abstract (Forma Astrat Singulari) nouns. For example the root Ṡ-H-R when used in the context of nouns means poetry or poems. Poetry as an abstract concept is represented with the abstract form *Ṡahar* while a poem is represented with the material form *Ṡihar*. Some roots may have both forms defined, some may have only one or the other. 

Nouns (regular and irregular) can take on affixes such as: 
|    Affix    |     Meaning                                              |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
|    La-      |  Very little or none of                                  |
|    Ser-     |  Very much or all of                                     |
|    -ja      |  Land of or state of                                     |
|    -i       |  Plural                                                  |
|    na-      |  Plural prefix used if suffix or noun form can't be used |
|    -a       |  Singular                                                |
