# Alżapar Morphology: Noun Forms

Nouns can also be created via roots moddified with transfix forms. However it is much more common to have nouns which exist alone not connected to any root. As with verbs not every root may have every form defined. 

Given a root (1-2-3) and its general meaning (X) a noun may take the following forms: 
|   Form   |     Noun      |     Meaning                            |     Form Name             |
|----------|---------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------|
|    (N0)  |      N/A      |   Irregular non-rooted form            |     Forma (Non) Garib     |
|    (N1)  |  1i2a3/1a2a3  |   Singular noun form                   |     Forma Singulari       |
|    (N2)  |  1u2a3        |   Dual noun form                       |     Forma Dopju           |
|    (N3)  |  1u2u3        |   Plural noun form                     |     Forma Plural          |
|    (N4)  |  Mu12i3       |   Someone who does (X)                 |     Forma Aġent           |
|    (N5)  |  Ma12a3       |   Place where (x) is done              |     Forma Lokalita        |

Nouns (regular and irregular) can take on affixes such as: 
|    Affix    |     Meaning              |
|-------------|--------------------------|
|    La-      |  Very little or none of  |
|    -ja      |  Land of or state of     |

Irregular nouns can also take on affixes such as:
|    Affix    |     Meaning              |
|-------------|--------------------------|
|    -a       |     Singular             |
