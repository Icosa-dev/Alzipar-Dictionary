# Alzapar Morphology: Affixes

Pronouns can be attached to words such as prepositions to mark location or nouns to mark ownership. The following are the attached pronouns:

|   Affix   |   Pronoun     |
|-----------|---------------|
|    -ī     |     I         |
|    -nā    |     We        |
|    -kum   |     You       |
|    -kumā  |     You pl.   |
|    -hu    |     He        |
|    -hā    |     She       |
|    -humā  |     They      |
|    -hum   |     They pl.  |

These affixes can be used to mark ownership. For example: "my dog" would be "kalbī", "his dog" would be "kalbhu". These affixes can also be used to mark location as with prepositions. For example: "upon you" would be "alaykum".

The affix -ah or -at is used to mark a masculine noun as feminine. For example the word "milāk" means king but the word "milākah" means queen. If the masculine form ends in a consonant then -ah is used, -at is used if a word ends in a vowel sound. When this is done in the Arabic script the h/t sound takes the form of a closed Ta.

The affix -iyah is used to turn adjectives or nouns into abstract concepts. Similar to -ness or -ity in English. For example the word "bašar" means human and "bašariyah" means humanity; or ideologies like the suffix "-ism" in English, or for country names like the suffix "-ia" in English. Much like the affix -ah/-at the h sound takes the form of a closed Ta.
