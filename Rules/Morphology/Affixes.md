# Alzapar Morphology: Affixes

Pronouns can be attached to words such as prepositions to mark location or nouns to mark ownership. The following are the attached pronouns:

|   Affix   |   Pronoun     |
|-----------|---------------|
|    -ī     |     I         |
|    -nā    |     We        |
|    -kum   |     You       |
|    -kumā  |     You pl.   |
|    -hu    |     He        |
|    -hā    |     She       |
|    -humā  |     They      |
|    -hum   |     They pl.  |

These affixes can be used to mark ownership. For example: "my dog" would be "kalbī", "his dog" would be "kalbhu". These affixes can also be used to mark location as with prepositions. For example: "upon you" would be "alaykum".
