# Alzapar Phonology and Phonotactics: Phonotactics

Words which derive from a triconsonantal root and are regular have sylables which follow the (CC)V(C) structure.

Vowel elongation for root derived words is usually very regular. For polysylabic nouns and adjectives their elongated vowel tends to be the last one and for other polysylabic words their elongated vowel tends to be the second to last one.
