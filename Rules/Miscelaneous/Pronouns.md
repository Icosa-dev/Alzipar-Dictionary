# Alzapar Miscelaneous: Pronouns

A special feature of pronouns is how they are able to be used as suffixes tacked onto nouns or prepositions. For nouns the can be used to represent ownership as in the phrase *Fi-diżártú* where *diżár* is the noun (meaning "desire" or "wish") and *tu* is the suffix meaning "of you".

Pronoun suffixes can also be used on prepositions as in the phrase *Salám alájtú* where *aláj* means "upon" and is suffixed with *tu* meaning "you".

Because these are compound words the acute diacritic (if used) will fall both on the root and the pronoun.
