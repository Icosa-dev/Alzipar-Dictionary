# Alżapar Miscelaneous: Pronouns

A special feature of pronouns is how they are able to be used as suffixes tacked onto nouns or prepositions. For nouns the can be used to represent ownership as in the phrase *Fi-diżáratú* where *diżár* is the noun (meaning "desire" or "wish") and *atú* is the suffix meaning "of you". Note that an extra *a* is put between the noun root and pronoun suffix.

Pronoun suffixes can also be used on prepositions as in the phrase *Salám alájtu* where *aláj* means "upon" and is suffixed with *tu* meaning "you".
