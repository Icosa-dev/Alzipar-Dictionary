# Alzapar Miscelaneous: Numbers

Alzapar uses a base-10 number system and derives the names for the numbers from Romance languages.

## Cardinal Numbers

The basic cardinal numbers (starting from 0 to 10) are *Zejn*, *Wadá*, *Dwajn*, *Tiráh*, *Viráh*, *Firáh*, *Zeks*, *Ziván*, *Aqt*, *Nináh*, and *Dekár*. The larger base-10 places are *Ħundár* (100), *Kilár* (1,000), *Milár* (1,000,000), and *Bilár* (1,000,000,000).

Numbers are formed by how many multiples of powers of 10 they have. For example 325 would have 3x100, 2x10, and 5x1. So the word in Alzapar would be *tiráhħun dwájndek u firáh*. The ones place does not have to specify that it is. For the 10s place and above their stressed sylable is removed (*dekár* -> *dek*, *ħundár* -> *ħun*, etc). There is a *u* put between the 10s and ones place. 

## Ordinal and Fractional Numbers

The first 3 ordinal numbers are irregular. 1st, 2nd, and 3rd are *Príma, Sékon,* and *Terṡí*. If the ones place of any other number is one of those then it follows that pattern. For example 12th would be *dek u sekon*. 

For all other numbers, take the smallest place and remove the stressed sylable (if polysylabic) and add *te*. For example 15th would be *al-dek-u-fírte*, 326th would be *at-tiráhħun-dwájndek-u-zékste*. For all of them the stress will be moved to the first sylable.

In the Latin script the "." symbol is used to mark ordinality.

The word for 1/2 and 1/4 are irregular and are *Sámi* and *Kárti*. 

Fractional numbers and ordinal numbers both use the same *te* suffix and stress change. However ordinal numbers are always definite.

## Decimal Values

For a decimal value the number before the point (*punt*) is said as usual. However the value after is pronounced digit by digit. For example 12.35 is *dek-u-zwajn punt tiráh firáh*.
