# Alzapar Miscelaneous: Numbers

Alzapar uses a base-10 number system and derives the names for the numbers from Romance languages.

## Cardinal Numbers

The basic cardinal numbers (starting from 0 to 10) are *Zayn*, *Wadā*, *Dawā*, *Tarā*, *Varā*, *Farā*, *Zaks*, *Zavān*, *Aqt*, *Ninā*, and *Dekār*. The larger base-10 places are *Hundār* (100), *Kalār* (1,000), *Malār* (1,000,000), and *Bilār* (1,000,000,000).

Numbers are formed by how many multiples of powers of 10 they have. For example 325 would have 3x100, 2x10, and 5x1. So the word in Alzapar would be *tirā'hun dawā'dek u firā*. The ones place does not have to specify that it is. There is a *u* put between the 10s and ones place. 

## Ordinal and Fractional Numbers

The first 3 ordinal numbers are irregular. 1st, 2nd, and 3rd are *Parām, Sakān,* and *Tarṡān*. If the ones place of any other number is one of those then it follows that pattern. For example 12th would be *dek u sakān*. 

For all other numbers, take the smallest place and remove the stressed sylable (if polysylabic) and add *-tī*. For example 15th would be *al-dek-u-firtī*, 326th would be *at-tirā'hun-dawā'dek-u-zakstī*. The elongated vowel is moved to the *-tī*.

In the Latin script the "." symbol is used to mark ordinality.

The word for 1/2 and 1/4 are irregular and are *Samī* and *Kartī*. 

Fractional numbers and ordinal numbers both use the same *-ti* suffix and stress change. However ordinal numbers are always definite.

## Decimal Values

For a decimal value the number before the point (*punt*) is said as usual. However the value after is pronounced digit by digit. For example 12.35 is *dek-u-dawā punt tirā firā*.
