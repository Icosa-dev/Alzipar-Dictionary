## A Note on the Dictionary

Roots will be defined vaguely. The verb forms will be defined by an infinitive and the noun forms by a plural material or abstract noun. Further meanings should be derived from there. For any root the meanings can be derived usually from just the verb meaning (V) or the noun meaning (N). Verb meanings usually follow the logic of "to make the quality of N", noun meanings usually follow the logic of "the product of V", and descriptive meanings usually follow the logic of "One/something who/that is N-like" (adjective) or "In a manner like (the) N" (adverb).
